 * Linear-sample Gaussian taps for one separable blur axis, computed on the CPU. The kernel is
 * symmetric, so only the right half is stored and each stored tap serves the +/- pair; the t=0 tap is
 * implicit with unit weight. Recomputed only when the radius changes (cheap, even when animated).
 * <p>
 * Each tap samples <em>between</em> two adjacent texels at a weight-biased offset so a single
 * GL_LINEAR fetch returns both texels' contribution - halving fetches versus one-per-texel. Taps run
 * out to +/-3 sigma; sigma = radius * 0.57735 + 0.5 (Skia's SkBlurMask::ConvertRadiusToSigma,
 * 0.57735 ~= 1/sqrt(3)), the radius->sigma mapping RenderScript and RenderEffect use, so a given
 * radius matches their strength across API levels.

     * {@code 0.57735 ~= 1/sqrt(3)} is the Skia / RenderScript / RenderEffect convention, and the

     * {@code exp(-t^2 / 2*sigma^2)} is sampled at integer texel offsets {@code t = 1, 2, ...} out to
     * {@code 3*sigma}, past which its weight is negligible; {@code twoSigmaSquared} is that
     * denominator, precomputed once.
     * <p>
     * Adjacent texel pairs {@code (t, t+1)} are then fused into one bilinear tap: a single GL_LINEAR
     * fetch at the weight-biased offset {@code (t*w0 + (t+1)*w1) / (w0 + w1)} returns exactly
     * {@code w0*texel(t) + w1*texel(t+1)} once scaled by the stored pair weight {@code w0 + w1}, so
     * two texels cost one fetch. An odd trailing texel with no partner is stored as a plain tap at its
     * integer offset. Weights are left unnormalized - the shader divides by their in-bounds sum.
